                Developing the ability to code will allow you to build things
                that you and other people might get value from in one way or
                another. Being able to build things almost from scratch,
                something impressive. So why not giving it a try?

                The most important thing you need to undestand is that there is
                no magic way to learn than practicing, building your own
                projects, making code your own. That&#39;s it.

                But where do I start? Think about what you want to build,
                something that interests you, and you&#39;ll find the path you
                need to follow. For me the first was to be able to be present on
                the net, and therefore I went for web development (both
                front-end and back-end). But your case may be AI &amp; Machine
                Learning, Blockchain, IoT or whatsoever.

                trending technologies on that topic. Look both for community

                I&#39;m refering to the tech stack that companies are using and

                Some people might lean more towards reading and others might
                prefer some more visual content as videos when learning. There
                are a lot of sources (free and paid) to learn from, each suiting
                different preferences.

                Choose whatever fits you the most but avoid at all costs the
                tutorial hell. Code along the documentation or video content you
                are following to learn whatever. If you are not being active,
                the most probable outcome is that you are going to forget it all
                soon.

                So, to brief things up, for me both kinds of learning work out
                but recently I&#39;m leaning more towards official documentation
                since it is going to be always the most updated source and
                usually the best place to start from zero.

                The first thing you are going to need is an IDE (integrated
                development environment). The IDE is the place where you&#39;re
                going to be writing code. The one I recommend the most and the
                one I use is VS Code, available for MacOS, Windows and Linux
                users.

              <p class="post-txt">
                One of the reasons I like it is the big amount of extensions
                available to help you with your development and it&#39;s
                interface, very user-friendly.

                With Git, you can control the updates that you and maybe other
                people you might work with do on any project files. Here is the

                Now, how about hosting your code or working together with other
                people on a project? GitHub is code hosting platform for version
